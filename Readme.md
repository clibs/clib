## Installation

```
$ npm install -g visionmedia/cpm
```

## About

  Basically the lazy-man's copy / paste, promoting smaller C utilities, also
  serving as a nice way to discover these sort of libraries, from my experience
  they are scattered all over the web and discovery is relatively poor. The wiki [listing of packages](https://github.com/visionmedia/cpm/wiki/Packages) acts as the "registry" and populates the `cpm-search(1)` results.

  `cpm(1)` is not a package manager for an end-user experience, for example it currently
  has no concept of dependencies etc, you should use `cpm(1)` to fetch these files for you
  and check them into your repository, the end-user and contributors will not require `cpm(1)`.

## Usage

```

Usage: cpm [options] [command]

Commands:

  install <pkg>          install the given package(s)
  help [cmd]             display help for [cmd]

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number

```

## Examples

 Install a few dependencies to `./deps`:

```
$ cpm install visionmedia/ms.c visionmedia/commander.c
```

 Install them to `./src` instead:

```
$ cpm install visionmedia/ms.c visionmedia/commander.c -o src
```

 Install some executables:

```
$ cpm install visionmedia/mon visionmedia/every visionmedia/watch
```

  Once again with brace expansion, you do love brace expansion right? ;)

```
$ cpm install visionmedia/{mon,every,watch}
```
